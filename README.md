# Project_Student_Performance_Prediction.ipynb
This project develops machine learning models to predict student academic performance using the UCI Student Performance dataset. A regression model was built to predict final grades, achieving an RÂ² score of 0.72. Additionally, classification models were developed to predict pass/fail outcomes with 90% accuracy.
