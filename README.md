A machine learning project to predict student academic performance and identify key factors influencing success, helping educational institutions provide proactive support.

### üöÄ Project Overview

This project addresses the challenge of identifying at-risk students by building predictive models based on demographic, social, and academic data. The goal is to provide educational institutions with a data-driven tool for early intervention. The project involves two main tasks:
1.  **Regression:** Predicting a student's final numeric grade.
2.  **Classification:** Predicting whether a student will pass or fail.

### ‚ú® Key Features

- **Data Exploration (EDA):** In-depth analysis of student data to uncover initial trends and correlations.
- **Data Preprocessing:** A complete pipeline for cleaning data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
- **Dual-Task Modeling:** Implements both regression and classification models to provide a comprehensive performance analysis.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Uses a wide range of metrics (R¬≤, RMSE, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score) for robust model assessment.
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Identifies the key drivers of academic success from the dataset.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

The project follows a standard machine learning workflow:

1.  **Data Understanding:** The [UCI Student Performance Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance) was used. Initial analysis was performed to understand its structure, quality, and statistical properties.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations such as histograms and a correlation heatmap were created to identify relationships between variables, especially their impact on the final grade (`G3`).
3.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    - A binary `pass_fail` feature was engineered from the `G3` grade.
    - Categorical features were converted to a numerical format using one-hot encoding.
    - All features were scaled using `StandardScaler` to prepare the data for modeling.
4.  **Model Building:**
    - **Regression Task:** A Multiple Linear Regression model was trained to predict the final grade.
    - **Classification Task:** Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models were trained to predict the pass/fail outcome.
5.  **Model Evaluation:** The models were evaluated on an unseen test set (20% of the data) to measure their real-world performance.

### üìä Results & Key Insights

The models demonstrated strong predictive capabilities:

| Model / Task | Metric | Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Linear Regression** | R¬≤ Score | **0.72** |
| **Classification Models** | Accuracy | **90%** |
| (Logistic & Decision Tree) | F1-Score | **0.92** |

**Key Insight:** The feature importance analysis revealed that a student's **second-period grade (`G2`)** is overwhelmingly the most significant predictor of their final academic outcome, accounting for over 70% of the decision-making power in the model. Other important factors include **parental education (`Medu`)**, student **absences**, and social habits.
